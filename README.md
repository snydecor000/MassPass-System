# MassPass-System
The main premis of this project is to eliminate the need for paper passes in the cafeteria and 333 studyhalls

Contained within the project there are two separate clients: the teacher client and the study hall client.

Using the teacher client, teachers are able to send passes to students through their Center Grove Gmail, then students scan these passes at a study hall client and it will track their location throughout the school.
